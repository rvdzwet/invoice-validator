    "instructions": [
      "**Part 1: General Document Analysis**",
      "1. **Language Identification:** Analyze the text for characteristic linguistic features (vocabulary, grammar, syntax, common words, diacritics) to identify the primary language. Provide a confidence score (0-100).",
      "2. **Sentiment Analysis:** Determine the overall sentiment expressed in the document (e.g., positive, negative, neutral, mixed). Provide a sentiment label and a confidence score (0-100) for each sentiment category.",
      "3. **Topic Identification:** Identify the main topics or themes discussed in the document. Provide a list of relevant topics with associated confidence scores (0-100) for each topic.",
      "4. **Key Entity Recognition:** Identify and categorize key entities mentioned in the document (e.g., persons, organizations, locations, dates, numbers, products). Provide a list of entities with their types and confidence scores (0-100).",
      "5. **Contextual Understanding:** Consider the context of the document when performing all analyses. For example, a document containing financial terms might influence topic identification.",
      "6. **Explanation:** For each analysis (language, sentiment, topics, entities), provide a brief explanation of the reasoning behind your determination.",

      "**Part 2: Document Type Identification**",
      "7. Identify key document markers:",

      "   - For quotes: validity period, estimated costs, terms.",
      "   - For receipts: payment confirmation, transaction date, merchant details.",
      "8. Analyze the document structure, looking for sections typical of invoices (header with invoice details, body with line items, footer with totals and payment information), quotes, or receipts.",
      "9. Check for document-specific terminology such as 'Invoice', 'Quotation', 'Receipt', 'Bill to', 'Due date', 'Payment terms', etc.",
      "10. If the document contains vendor name '{vendorName}', consider this in your analysis.",
      "11. Provide a classification for the document type.",
      "12. Provide a confidence score (0-100) for your document type classification.",

      "**Part 3: Output Formatting**",
      "14. IMPORTANT: Your response MUST be a valid JSON object with the exact structure shown in the JSON schema.",
      "15. Do not include any explanations, notes, or text outside of the JSON structure.",
      "16. Ensure all fields are properly formatted according to their expected types:",
      "    - String fields should contain text values",
      "    - Numeric fields should contain numbers without quotes",

# Bouwdepot Invoice Validator Enhancements

This project has been enhanced with multi-modal validation and audit transparency features to make the invoice validation process more robust and transparent.

## Recent Updates

### Build Fixes (April 2025)

- Fixed service dependency issues in `GeminiServiceProxy` to properly reference the correct Gemini services
- Corrected namespace references for Gemini services to use the proper `Gemini` namespace
- Added missing `ExtractInvoiceDataFromImagesAsync` method to `GeminiAdvancedAnalysisService`
- Fixed property mapping in `GeminiAdvancedAnalysisService` to match the `Invoice` and `PaymentDetails` models
- Resolved type conversion issues between decimal and int values in line item processing

## New Features

### 1. Multi-Modal Validation

The application now uses both text and visual analysis to validate invoices:

- **Text Analysis**: Extracts and analyzes text content for home improvement-related keywords and patterns
- **Visual Analysis**: Examines the visual structure, layout, and elements of the invoice
- **Combined Assessment**: Cross-references both text and visual elements for consistency and signs of fraud

### 2. Audit-Ready Documentation

The validation process now produces comprehensive, audit-ready documentation:

- **Detailed Assessment Framework**: Clear evaluation criteria with weighted scoring
- **Evidence Collection**: Specific evidence for each criterion
- **Confidence Scoring**: Confidence metrics for different aspects of the assessment
- **Regulatory References**: Documentation of relevant Dutch regulations when applicable
- **Comprehensive Justification**: Detailed explanation of the decision process

### 3. Enhanced Fraud Detection

Improved fraud detection with:

- **Visual Anomaly Detection**: Detection of visual inconsistencies that might indicate tampering
- **Mathematical Verification**: Calculation checks for line items and totals
- **Missing Information Analysis**: Detection of missing critical legal elements

## Configuration Options

You can configure these features in the `appsettings.json` file:

```json
"Validation": {
  "UseMultiModalAnalysis": true,
  "GenerateAuditReadyResults": true
}
```

- **UseMultiModalAnalysis**: Enable/disable multi-modal validation (text + visual analysis)
- **GenerateAuditReadyResults**: Enable/disable comprehensive audit documentation

## User Interface Improvements

The UI now displays:

- **Audit Documentation**: Detailed explanation of the decision-making process
- **Criteria Assessment**: Breakdown of scores for different validation criteria
- **Visual Assessment**: Results of the visual analysis of the invoice
- **Confidence Metrics**: Confidence scores for each aspect of the validation

## Implementation Details

### Text Analysis

The system uses enhanced prompts for Gemini AI to more accurately classify invoices:

- More detailed industry context for Dutch construction
- Specific guidance on home improvement vs. non-home improvement expenses
- Structured analysis with weighted criteria

### Visual Analysis

The visual analysis pipeline includes:

- Page image extraction from PDFs
- Layout and structure analysis
- Logo and signature detection
- Visual tampering detection
- Document inconsistency identification

### Multi-Modal Integration

The system combines text and visual analysis using:

- Cross-verification between text and visual elements
- Detection of contradictions between text content and visual elements
- Weighted scoring across both textual and visual criteria

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for further enhancement:

1. Advanced machine learning for tamper detection
2. Historical pattern analysis across submitted invoices
3. Integration with external KvK verification APIs
4. Price benchmarking against market rates
5. Integration with banking APIs to verify payments
